# Message spammer
Instagram (desktop web version) / Discord / Whatsapp (desktop version) / Microsoft Teams message spammer.
Please note that this script may work for other Messaging applications / websites as well, the ones listed above are the ones that tests have been conducted on.

Windows:

*Prerequisites*:
None :)


*Instructions*:
Download the file named 'spammerX.X.exe", where X.X is the version number, and run it, and then follow the on-screen instructions.

*Linux/macOS/Non-Windows*:

Prerequisites:
Make sure latest Python version is installed.


*Instructions*:
Download the file named 'spammerX.X(non-windows).py", where X.X is the version number, and run it, and then follow the on-screen instructions.

DO NOT MOVE THE MOUSE WHILE IT IS SPAMMING.

Notes: 
1. Time interval is measured in seconds.
2. WhatsApp minimum time interval is 0.1, while for Microsoft Teams it is 0.4/0.3. This is to avoid any glitches.
3. The non-windows script does in fact work on any Operating System, AS LONG AS the OS supports Python and the latest version of Python is installed.
4. The non-windows script does work on Windows, but why use a Python script when you can use an .exe with no prior set-up?
